// LoRa is slow and EU law allows a transmitter at most 10 % airtime in the 869.4–869.65 MHz
// sub-band. The scheduler queues events, sends the most urgent first, keeps a rolling one-hour
// airtime budget, thins positions, repeats an own SOS until someone acknowledges or cancels it,
// and applies the bridging rules to events that came from the server (ADR-0015, ADR-0043). It is
// pure: time and randomness are passed in, and the caller does the sending: it takes one packet
// with `next`, then reports `sent` or `retry`.
