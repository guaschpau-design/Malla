# @tesel/protocol

The single implementation of [`docs/protocol.md`](../../docs/protocol.md): event encoding and decoding, group key derivation, internet envelopes, the relay's messages, invitation links, log files and the weather warnings a server publishes.

Pure TypeScript. No DOM, no Node APIs, no network. Runs unchanged in the browser, in Node and in tests. It defines the bytes; keeping them is not its job. The event log and the outbox live in the app (`apps/web/src/lib/events/event-log.ts`), and what goes on the radio is decided in `packages/core`.

Bad input is answered in one of three ways, by who is at fault and what the caller can do with it:

- **A `Result` with an error code** (`result.ts`) from what decodes bytes or text another device or a user sent, when the reason matters: an event, an invitation, a log file, a client's message to the relay, which the relay answers with the code.
- **`null`** from what reads something that is either valid or useless, with nothing to tell about why: a server's message or information, base64url, an envelope that does not open with the group's key.
- **An exception** (`RangeError`) for a mistake in the calling code, such as a key or secret of the wrong size: it is a bug, not input to handle.

`test-helpers.ts` holds the fixtures of this package's tests, a round-trip sample of every event type among them; it is not exported.

To inspect an encoded event:

```sh
pnpm --filter @tesel/protocol decode 0104a1b2c3d4010000000013fc68486f6c61
```
