# 0044. Keep each author's events in order, and say when a clock is wrong

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-27

## Context

ADR-0003 orders concurrent edits by `(time, origin, seq)` and says that wrong clocks only affect tie-breaking. The audit of 27 October 2026 found two cases where they do more:

- A device whose clock goes back (a manual change, a phone that loses its battery and starts in 1970 or 2000) stamps new events earlier than its own old ones. Its later edit of a marker or a task then loses to its earlier one, everywhere, for good.
- A device whose clock runs ahead wins every concurrent edit until the others catch up with it, and its positions look newer than they are.

It also found that a receiver stored any event whose header could be read, even a known type whose payload did not decode. Stored under its `(origin, seq)`, such a damaged copy hid the real event when it arrived later.

Ordering one author's events by `seq` inside `compareEvents` would break the order's transitivity once a third author's event falls between them, and with it the reducer's independence from arrival order. Hiding events stamped in the future would hide an SOS from a phone with a wrong clock, which is worse than any misordered marker.

## Decision

- **A device never stamps an event earlier than its previous one** (protocol §3.1): it keeps the time of its last event and uses it while its clock is behind. One author's events are then always in `seq` order under `(time, origin, seq)`, with no change to the order itself.
- **Events from the future are shown as they come.** No event is hidden or delayed because of its time.
- **The device is told when its clock is wrong.** The server says its time in `healthz` (protocol §8.1); when the device's clock differs from it by more than two minutes, a notice on the map says how far ahead or behind it is and asks to set it right.
- **Damaged events are dropped, not stored** (protocol §3.1): a known type that does not decode never takes the place of the real event.

ADR-0003's last consequence is corrected accordingly.

## Consequences

- A phone that went back in time keeps its own edits in order; others still see its events with the times it stamped, which may be in the past.
- A phone whose clock runs ahead still wins concurrent edits until it is set right; with no server reachable, nothing tells it so.
- Older versions of the app may still hold damaged events; they are dropped only as new copies arrive, not cleaned up.
