# Architecture decision records

Each file records one decision: the context, what we chose and what follows from it. Records are never edited after acceptance except for their status line, which names the later records that amend, settle or supersede them; a changed decision gets a new record. The status column below mirrors each status line.

Template: copy [`template.md`](template.md), use the next number, keep it under a page.
