# Keeps a Tesel server on the newest published image, and only on
# images this repository's CI built and signed (docs/decisions/0049-signed-images-and-checked-updates.md):
#
#   1. cosign checks the signature of the image TESEL_IMAGE_TAG (default "latest") names and
#      gives its digest;
#   2. that digest is pulled and started, and must become healthy (the image's health check
#      asks the server's /healthz);
#   3. if it does not, the previous image is started again, from the local copy kept for this,
#      and the new digest is remembered as rejected, so it is not tried again.
#
# With nothing new it only makes sure the containers run and the server is healthy. The images
# in use are recorded in the project's .env: TESEL_IMAGE (running), TESEL_IMAGE_PREVIOUS and
# TESEL_IMAGE_REJECTED.
#
#   update.sh DIRECTORY             update (run by the installers and by a timer)
#   update.sh DIRECTORY rollback    go back to TESEL_IMAGE_PREVIOUS and reject the current image
